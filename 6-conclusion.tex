This paper introduces Semantic Gossip, a communication substrate that takes application semantics into account to optimize performance.
Semantic Gossip relies on two techniques, semantic filtering and semantic aggregation.
With semantic filtering, the gossip protocol can stop propagating messages that have become redundant from the perspective of the application.
With semantic aggregation, the gossip protocol can replace multiple messages by a single message of equivalent meaning.
Both techniques reduce the number of messages that are propagated by gossip without penalizing the resilience of the consensus protocol.

We have demonstrated the usefulness of Semantic Gossip using Tendermint, a well-known consensus protocol.  It enables to scale ...
